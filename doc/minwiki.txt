Minwiki is a collection of functions designed to let you easily maintain a
personal wiki in Vim in markdown. You can use minwiki for anything that can be
done with a wiki. The author of this software uses minwiki to keep a collection
of linked notes.

This project is entirely inspired by Vimwiki, which I used briefly until I
became dissatisfied with the way markdown is treated. Markdown is the only
supported language for wiki pages in Minwiki. The plugin is designed to impact
the default markdown configuration and plugins a little as possible. (In
particular, tagged code fences still work.)

To get started, press <Leader>ww to open the wiki index page, the main page of
your wiki. By deafult, this is located in ~/wiki/index.md.

You can use any valid markdown syntax in your wiki. Get started with the
following example:
>
 # My Wiki

 * Lists
 * Resources
 * Other
>
Copy and paste this into your index. Then place your cursor over the word
"Lists" and press <Enter> to surround the word in brackets. Press <Enter>
again to create a link. Press <Enter> again to follow that link to a new file
called lists.md.

2. Mappings                                                     *minwiki-mappings*

Minwiki creates both global and local mappings. Global mappings are accessible
from any buffer, whereas local mappings are only available in buffers where
'filetype' is set to 'minwiki'. This is set automatically for all files in the
folder |g:minwiki_path|.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Global Mappings                                   *minwiki-global-mappings*

						   *<Leader>ww*  *minwiki-index*
<Leader>ww	Opens the index page. If the current buffer is a wiki page,
		then the current buffer is replaced with the index. Otherwise,
		the index is opened in a new tab. Maps to <Plug>(minwiki-index).

						       *<Leader>wg* *minwiki-go*
<Leader>wg	Go to the given wiki page, specified by the filename of the page
		with the extension. If page does not exist, a new page with the
		given name will open. Maps to <Plug>(minwiki-go).

						   *<Leader>wr* *minwiki-rename*
<Leader>wr	Rename a page. This updates all links already directed at the
		original page and will change the filename of the page. Maps
		to <Plug>(minwiki-rename).

						   *<Leader>wd* *minwiki-delete*
<Leader>wd	Delete a page. This removes all links to the given page and
		deletes the file with the page name. Be sure that your wiki is
		properly backed up, as page deletion cannot be undone. Maps to
		<Plug>(minwiki-delete).

To redefine a global mapping, simply create a new map in your vimrc.
For example, to map <Leader>i to <Plug>(minwiki-index), put >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>i <Plug>(minwiki-index)
somewhere in your vimrc. The |<silent>| flag prevents the command line from
echoing the command. Notice that we used |nmap| instead of |nnoremap| because
we need to access the remapped version of <Plug>(minwiki-index).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Local Mappings                                     *minwiki-local-mappings*

							*<CR>* *minwiki-enter*
<CR>		Open the wiki link under the cursor. If no link exists,
		surround the current |WORD| in brackets. If cursor is between
		brackets, create a link to the text between the brackets.
		Maps to <Plug>(minwiki-enter).

						    *<BS>* *minwiki-prev-page*
<BS>		Go to the previous wiki page in the current window. Mapts to
		<Plug>(minwiki-prev-page).

						   *<Tab>* *minwiki-next-link*
<Tab>		Move cursor to next markdown link in the current buffer. Maps
		to <Plug>(minwiki-next-link).

						 *<S-Tab>* *minwiki-prev-link*
<S-Tab>		Move cursor to previous markdown link in the current buffer.
		Maps to <Plug>(minwiki-prev-link).

To redefine a local mapping, create the file ~/.vim/after/minwiki.vim and add
the new mappings.

For example, >
	nmap <silent> <buffer> <LocalLeader>n <Plug>(minwiki-next-link)
remaps <LocalLeader>n to <Plug>(minwiki-next-link). This does not remove the
existing map. See |unmap|.

The |<buffer>| argument keeps this remap local to the current buffer, and
|<silent>| prevents the command line from echoing the command. Note that you
must use |nmap| instead of |nnoremap| because the command needs to access the
remapped version of <Plug>(minwiki-next-link).
